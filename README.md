# Movie_Ticket_Booking_Project
  The main objective of our project was to allow users to book tickets for their 
favorite movie which is currently available at a particular theatre. Instead of the traditional 
way of booking movie tickets by going physically to the theatre, checking all the movies that 
are currently active, getting information about available shows, timings, and their price, 
waiting in the queue, and then booking the tickets for a particular show, the project aims to 
provide all the functionality to just at the matter of clicks. The project provides broadly two 
functionalities i.e. one for the admin and for the user. In admin login, the theater owner can 
maintain all the active running movies in the app. The owner can also add newly released 
movies, delete old movies, keep track of booking for each show, and can manage their 
customer's data as well. On the other hand, the user can easily surf through all the movies 
that are currently active, see movie details, watch the trailers, check the price, book the 
tickets for a show, make payment, etc. Therefore, It not only saves the time and effort of the 
users but also allows users to get the work done conveniently and more efficiently.

  The backend of the project has been created using Spring Boot, and Hibernate5. 
Whereas the technologies used to develop the front end are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSP. 
The relational database i.e. MySQL is used to store the data of the user and the movies.
